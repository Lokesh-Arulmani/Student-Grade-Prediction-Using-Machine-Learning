# Student Grade Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict student grades based on various attributes.

## Overview

The Student Grade Prediction project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict student grades. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, specifically linear regression, this project offers insights into student performance and assists educators in identifying areas for improvement.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: The project includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Linear regression model: The model utilizes the linear regression algorithm to establish the relationship between student attributes and grades.
- Jupyter Notebook: The code and documentation are provided in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand and execute the project.
